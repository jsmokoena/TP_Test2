    "#### Time Complexity:\n",
    "- **Best-case**: O(n)\n",
    "  - This occurs when the input array is already sorted. In this scenario, the inner loop condition (`arr[j] > key`) fails immediately for each element, and no shifting of elements is required. The algorithm makes a single pass through the array, performing n-1 comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Average-case**: O(n^2)\n",
    "  - This represents the scenario where the elements are in random order. On average, each element will need to be compared to half of the already sorted elements. Therefore, for each of the n elements, approximately n/2 comparisons and shifts are required, leading to a quadratic time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Worst-case**: O(n^2)\n",
    "  - This occurs when the input array is sorted in reverse order. In this case, each new element must be compared with all previously sorted elements and shifted to the correct position, resulting in approximately n^2/2 comparisons and shifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Space Complexity:\n",
    "- **Space Complexity**: O(1)\n",
    "  - Insertion Sort is an in-place sorting algorithm, meaning it requires only a constant amount of additional memory space beyond the input array. The extra space is used for a few variables like the key, i, and j.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Efficiency in Big-O Notation:\n",
    "- **Best-case Efficiency (O(n))**:\n",
    "  - Insertion Sort is very efficient when dealing with nearly sorted data or small datasets. In the best case, where the array is already sorted, the algorithm performs only n-1 comparisons and does not need to shift any elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Average and Worst-case Efficiency (O(n^2))**:\n",
    "  - For larger datasets or datasets that are randomly ordered or sorted in reverse, the efficiency of Insertion Sort decreases significantly. The quadratic time complexity means that the time taken grows exponentially with the number of elements, making it inefficient for large datasets.\n",

    "In conclusion, Insertion Sort is a useful algorithm for specific scenarios where the dataset is small or nearly sorted. However, for larger or more unordered datasets, more advanced sorting algorithms like Merge Sort or Quick Sort, which have better average and worst-case time complexities (O(n log n)), are generally preferred."
